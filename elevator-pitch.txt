Building your own computer can help you save money and increase the power of the system. Most people would ask, "isn't that hard?" Don't worry it's actually a lot easier then you think. It can be similar to building legos or an ikea dresser. I've built more then a dozen for friends and family and will help you understand the basic parts of a computer and the steps of building a computer so that you can build your own too.

Feedback, Greer:
Sounds good. Background is valid and good. Do a better job convincing people they would want to build a computer.

Feedback, Rhys and Niamh:
Clear and consise, didn't have any questions about the purpose.
